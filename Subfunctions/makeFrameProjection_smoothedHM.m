function makeFrameProjection_smoothedHM(thisFileImName, inputDir, outputDir,calibrationXY, offset, smoothHM, CLAHE,zLimit)
% makeFrameProjection(thisFileImName, inputDir, heightDir, outputDir, scalingxy, offset, nProject, typeProject );
%
% this function takes a 3D image matrix data from file thisFileImName in inputDir [N x M x Planes] and a
% heightMap z(x,y) from a file in "heightDir" which is scaled by the factor "scalingxy" to a size [N*scalingxy x M*scalingxy].
% The function calculates the projected images along a
% surface that is at distance "offset" in the z direction from the
% surface defined by the heightMap. The projection is done over "nProject"
% number of image planes using the "typeProj" projection.
%
% Input variables:
% thisFileImName    the (base) file name
% inputDir          the full directory name of the input 3D image
% heightDir         the full directory name of the input height map
% outputDir         the full directory name of the output (projection images)
% scalingxy         the factor of scaling of in the xy direction (<1 for downsampling, =1 for no scaling)
% offset            offset distance in the z-direction (integer in z-planes) determining the position of the 1st plane of
%                   the surface wanted from the heightmap. Positive for above, negative for below.
%                   Can be a vector and then the output will contain multiple planes
% zLimit           Set limits for z-stack if there is a disturbing feature in the image stack that you would like to leave out of projections
%                   even if that plane is supposed to be included in the
%                   projection.
